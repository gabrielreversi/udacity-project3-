For additional information, see the Model Card paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.03993.pdf  

## Model Details  
- **Model Type**: Supervised Classification Model  
- **Algorithm**: Random Forest / Logistic Regression (update based on your final model)  
- **Framework**: Scikit-learn  
- **Input Features**: Various demographic and employment-related attributes  
- **Output**: Binary classification (e.g., likelihood of credit card churn)  
- **Version**: 1.0  

## Intended Use  
This model is designed to predict the probability of a customer churning based on demographic and transactional features. It is intended to help financial institutions proactively retain customers by identifying high-risk individuals and taking appropriate actions.  

## Training Data  
- **Source**: The dataset consists of anonymized customer data, including demographic details, employment status, income level, and transaction history.  
- **Size**: [Specify the number of records]  
- **Feature Engineering**: The data has undergone preprocessing steps such as categorical encoding, missing value imputation, and feature selection.  

## Evaluation Data  
- **Dataset Split**: The data was split into training and test sets (e.g., 80% training, 20% testing).  
- **Preprocessing**: The same transformations applied to training data were applied to test data.  

## Metrics  
The model was evaluated using the following metrics:  
- **Accuracy**: [Specify Score]  
- **Precision**: [Specify Score]  
- **Recall**: [Specify Score]  
- **F1-Score**: [Specify Score]  
- **ROC-AUC**: [Specify Score]  

## Ethical Considerations  
- **Bias & Fairness**: The model may be influenced by biases present in the dataset. It is recommended to perform fairness testing and mitigate any potential biases.  
- **Privacy**: The model does not use personally identifiable information (PII).  
- **Impact**: Incorrect predictions could lead to misclassification of customers, affecting business decisions. Human oversight is recommended when using model outputs.  

## Caveats and Recommendations  
- The model's performance depends on the quality and representativeness of the training data.  
- Periodic retraining is recommended to account for shifts in customer behavior.  
- It is advised to monitor model drift and recalibrate when necessary.
